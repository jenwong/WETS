WETS
====
WETS stands for the WalkFirst Element Tracking System. Each ranked intersection receiving improvements informed by the WalkFirst prioritization process has an associated Excel workbook (also known as WET sheets). The contents of each workbook detail the specific countermeasure and costs that will be implemented at that intersection. Information from the WET sheets are aggregated in a separate summary workbook.
